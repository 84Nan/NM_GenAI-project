# Simple Intelligent AI Chatbot

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basic yet intelligent chatbot using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries across various domains, such as customer service, education, and entertainment.

## Features
- Utilizes NLTK library for natural language processing tasks.
- Implements tokenization, lemmatization, and punctuation removal for input preprocessing.
- Employs a bag-of-words model for understanding and generating responses.
- Trained on a predefined set of intents and responses stored in JSON format.
- Provides functionalities for saving and loading the trained model using pickle.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- TensorFlow (for training the model)
- JSON (for handling intents and responses)
- Pickle (for saving and loading the trained model)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the chatbot using the provided script or integrate it into your application.

## File Structure
- `chatbot.py`: Main script for running the chatbot.
- `intents.json`: JSON file containing predefined intents and responses.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the chatbot model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Training the Model
To train the chatbot model with your own intents and responses:
1. Modify the `intents.json` file to include your desired intents and responses.
2. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model using the updated data.
